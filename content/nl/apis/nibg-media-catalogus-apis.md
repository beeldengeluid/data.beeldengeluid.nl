As an institute for media culture, Sound and Vision manages a media collection in the broadest sense of the word, from written press, film, radio and television to computer games, online video and websites, whether or not professionally produced. A large part of this collection is stored digitally. We manage this digital collection in such a reliable and sustainable way that we are the first national audiovisual archive in the world to be awarded the Data Seal of Approval.

The collection is built on four thematic pillars: 'News, information and current affairs', 'Culture and entertainment', 'Amateur and corporate productions', and 'Media landscape'.
