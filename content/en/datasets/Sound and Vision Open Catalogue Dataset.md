# Sound and Vision Open Catalogue Dataset

This dataset contains the catalogue metadata of the majority of the collections of the Netherlands Institute of Sound and Vision. We have selected those metadata fields that are not protected by copyright, or to which Sound and Vision itself is the rights holder, and released them under a [Creative Commons CC0 license](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/ "CC0 License").

To facilitate users of this dataset we made the following decisions:

* We transformed our internal metadata format to [Schema.org](https://schema.org/ "Schema.org") 
* We included links to our General Public Portal to the catalogue, from which materials can be ordered
* If the material described in the metadata is available under an open license we have included a link to that item on our [Open Images](https://openimages.eu/ "Open Images") platform, where it can be downloaded in various formats
* We created a SPARQL-endpoint which allows users to build their own queries, or use and tweak some of the example queries that we have provided in the interface.

We will continue to expand and improve on this dataset. Please contact us with any specific requirements or use case that you might have.
