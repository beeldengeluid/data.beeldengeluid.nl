Common Thesaurus for Audiovisual Archives, GTAA

Sound and Vision has teamed up with other Dutch heritage organizations that manage audiovisual cultural heritage to develop the Common Thesaurus for Audiovisual Archives (Gemeenschappelijke Thesaurus voor Audiovisuele Archieven) or GTAA. The GTAA is used for characterization of the content of audiovisual material from the archive with labels derived from a controlled and structured list of terms, a thesaurus.

The GTAA is made available under the Open Database License (OdbL).

The GTAA has several parts, that contain content that corresponds to the same informational units, like: Person names, (corporation and other) Names, Geographical Names, Subjects, Classification, Genre.

Every term of the thesaurus is a SKOS Concept with at least one preferred label. SKOS Concepts that belong to the same GTAA part are grouped in SKOS ConceptSchemes. These ConceptSchemes are available for download in RDF/XML using the OAI-PMH data provider. More information on harvesting of the data from the OAI-PMH data provider can be read on the [GTAA APIs page](en/apis/gtaa).
