From Beethoven to Metallica, from Pinkpop to The Big Sing. The MOZ (Muziekopnamen Zendgemachtigden) collection contains concert
recordings intended for broadcast by the Dutch public TV and radio broadcasters. 

The earliest recordings are from early in the 20th century. New concerts are still broadcast and periodically added to the collection.
The concerts are very diverse; almost 200 different musical genres are represented.
The largest genre is classical music, but jazz, theatre music, folk, indie and pop also appear.

Most of the concerts in the collection contain information about the artists involved. There are more than 36,000 artists, both individuals and musical groups.
Some of the persons are linked to WikiData or Discogs.
The concerts are predominantly - but not exclusively - produced by public broadcasters. 

This dataset is part of the dataset [Sound & Vision catalog Open Data](/nl/datasets/nisv-media-catalog).
This collection has been made available as Linked Data, with support from the [Polifonia](https://polifonia-project.eu/) and [Podiumkunst.net](https://www.podiumkunst.net/) projects
