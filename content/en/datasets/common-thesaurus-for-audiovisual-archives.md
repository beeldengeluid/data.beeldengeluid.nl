GTAA (Common Thesaurus for Audiovisual Archives)

Sound and Vision has teamed up with other Dutch heritage organizations that manage audiovisual cultural heritage to develop the Common Thesaurus for Audiovisual Archives (Gemeenschappelijke Thesaurus voor Audiovisuele Archieven) or GTAA. The GTAA is used for characterization of the content of audiovisual material from the archive with labels derived from a controlled and structured list of terms, a thesaurus.

The GTAA is made available under the Open Database License (OdbL) and as [linked open data](https://www.den.nl/aan-de-slag/uitvoeren/hoe-maak-je-het-beschikbaar/linked-open-data). For describing terms we use the [SKOS](https://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/) model that is widely used. Every term in the GTAA is a SKOS Concept with at least one preferred label and an [HTTP URI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier). 

The GTAA has several parts, that contain content that corresponds to the same informational units, like: Person names, Names (corporation and other), Geographical Names, Subjects, Classification, Genre. SKOS Concepts that belong to the same category are grouped in SKOS ConceptSchemes. 


For working with the GTAA several [APIs](apis/gtaa) are available.
