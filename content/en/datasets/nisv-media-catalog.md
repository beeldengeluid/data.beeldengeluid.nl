# Sound and Vision media catalog Open Data
As an institute for media culture, Sound and Vision manages a media collection in the broadest sense of the word, from written press, film, radio and television to computer games, online video and websites, whether or not professionally produced. A large part of this collection is stored digitally. We manage this digital collection in such a reliable and sustainable way that we are the first national audiovisual archive in the world to be awarded the Data Seal of Approval.

The collection is built on four thematic pillars: 'News, information and current affairs', 'Culture and entertainment', 'Amateur- and corporate productions', and 'Media landscape'.

This dataset contains the catalogue metadata of the majority of the collections of the Netherlands Institute of Sound and Vision. We have selected those metadata fields that are not protected by copyright, or to which Sound and Vision itself is the rights holder, and released them under a [Creative Commons CC0 license](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/ "CC0 License").

To facilitate users of this dataset we made the following decisions:

* We map relevant metadata fields from our internal metadata format to [Schema.org](https://schema.org/ "Schema.org").
* We provide links from the catalog items metadata to our General Public Portal, where materials can be ordered or played.
* The metadata about the objects contains machine-readable rights and licensing information from [rightsstatement.org](https://rightsstatements.org/en/ "rightsstatement.org") and [creativecommons.org](https://creativecommons.org/ "creativecommons.org"). If the material described in the metadata is available under an open license we have included a direct link to that item on our [Open Images](https://openimages.eu/) platform, from where it can be downloaded in various formats.
* We offer a SPARQL endpoint, which allows users to build their own queries or use and modify sample queries in the user interface.

We will continue to expand and improve on this dataset. Please contact us with any specific requirements or use case that you might have.
