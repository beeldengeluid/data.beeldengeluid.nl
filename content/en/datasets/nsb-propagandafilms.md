This dataset is a subset of the Open Images dataset. It contains film material of the Film service of the Dutch National Socialist Movement (NSB). In 1941 Mussert appointed member of the NSB, G.J. Teunissen as leader of the Film Service of the NSB. Under his supervision they started producing their own cinema news reels 'Spiegel der Beweging' (Mirror of the Movement).
