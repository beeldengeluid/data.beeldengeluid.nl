The Netherlands Instituite for Sound and Vision works together with Internet Memory Research (crawling proces), Dispectu (back-end) en Frontwise (front-end) to archive a selection of Dutch broadcaster's and other media related webpages. In a pilot with the NTR four websites were crawled in 2013 and made available online.

A selection of approx. 55 websites is crawled during the Weeks of Dutch Television/Radio and serves a contextualizing purpose.
