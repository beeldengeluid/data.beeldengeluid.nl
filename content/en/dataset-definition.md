On this page you find the datasets that Sound & Vision makes available.

We define a _dataset_ as: "A collection of data and/or metadata, grouped according to a logical axis (e.g., thematic, license, etc.), collectively described and published. References to the actual objects may or may not be part of a dataset. The dataset as a whole is provided with additional metadata, such as a title, a description, and a license."
