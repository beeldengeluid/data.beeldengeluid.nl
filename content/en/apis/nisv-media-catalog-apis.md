As an institute for media culture, Sound and Vision manages a media collection in the broadest sense of the word, from written press, film, radio and television to computer games, online video and websites, whether or not professionally produced. A large part of this collection is stored digitally. We manage this digital collection in such a reliable and sustainable way that we are the first national audiovisual archive in the world to be awarded the Data Seal of Approval.

The collection is built on four thematic pillars: 'News, information and current affairs', 'Culture and entertainment', 'Amateur and corporate productions', and 'Media landscape'.

The available endpoints are:
* [Search](#search)
* [SPARQL](#sparql)

## Search

## SPARQL
RDF is a directed, labeled graph data format for representing information in the Web. RDF is often used to represent, among other things, personal information, social networks, metadata about digital artifacts, as well as to provide a means of integration over disparate sources of information. [W3C](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-sparql-query/#introduction)

More specific information on the syntax and semantics of the SPARQL query language for RDF can be found [here](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-sparql-query/).

We provide an HTML interface for human users that look for the endpoint in a browser. The same URL can be used by machines readers, that can negotiate return format with the server.
