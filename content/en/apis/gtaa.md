Sound and Vision has teamed up with several other Dutch organizations that manage audiovisual cultural heritage to develop the Gemeenschappelijke Thesaurus voor Audiovisuele Archieven (Common Thesaurus for Audiovisual Archives, GTAA). The GTAA is used for efficient characterization of the content of audio-visual material from the archive with labels derived from a controlled and structured list of terms, a thesaurus.

The GTAA is made available under the Open Database License (OdbL).
