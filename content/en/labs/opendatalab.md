The Open Data Lab experiments with making open data sets (digital objects, metadata, terms and enrichments) optimally available in order to participate in an (inter)national ecosystem of Open Data.

All this takes place on the public internet, in cooperation with users and partners. Connections are made with other heritage collections, the open community and other relevant sources on the internet.
